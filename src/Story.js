                I'm a Full Stack Developer form Mexico, based in Barcelona. Previously, I used to work in finance and Corporate Banking before I took a leap into the tech world.
                I graduated from a Full Stack Development Bootcamp at CodeOp, which is an international school for women in Barcelona.

                Once I tried how straight forward and satisfying coding was, I never looked back.
                I really enjoy the logic and problem-solving that goes behind the code.
